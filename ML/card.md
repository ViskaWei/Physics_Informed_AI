The harmonic mean strongly penalizes low values in a dataset compared to arithmetic and geometric means because it is based on reciprocals, making it highly sensitive to outliers near zero. It serves as the most conservative average, consistently yielding the lowest value (\(AM\ge GM\ge HM\)) and effectively requiring high values across all inputs, such as in precision-recall F1-scores. Why Harmonic Mean Penalizes Differences More: Sensitivity to Small Values: Because the harmonic mean uses the reciprocals of data (\(\frac{n}{\sum \frac{1}{x_{i}}}\)), small numbers create large reciprocals, which dominate the average and pull the final result closer to the lowest number in the set.Example (0% and 100%): If averaging \(100\%\) and \(0\%\) (e.g., in F1-score), the harmonic mean is \(0\%\), while the arithmetic mean is \(50\%\). The harmonic mean requires both inputs to be high to maintain a high average.Comparison to Other Means:Arithmetic Mean: Treats differences additively, treating a \(10\)-point difference similarly regardless of the magnitude of the numbers.Geometric Mean: Treats differences multiplicatively, mitigating high outliers better than the arithmetic mean but not as harshly as the harmonic mean.Harmonic Mean: Treats differences via reciprocals, ensuring that a single low value severely drags down the overall mean, making it ideal for rates and ratios where high variance is undesirable (e.g., average speeds). The harmonic mean is generally used when the data represents rates or ratios, as shown by the example of finding the average speed of \(30\) mph and \(60\) mph, which results in \(40\) mph, lower than the \(45\) mph arithmetic mean
